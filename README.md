## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this challenge I've tried to practise rems instead of pixels.

### Continued development

In the future I'd like to understand better an em unit and how and where it can be useful. I've actually started with them before rems, but its behaviour was confusing at a time.

### Useful resources

- [A modern CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/) - I heard about CSS Reset templates during my online course.. There is a lot of options out there, but I've decided to start with this one.
